## Background 

### Word Embeddings 

*Word embeddings* $\mathbf{w}=[w^{(1)}, w^{(2)}, ... , w^{(d)}]$ are numerical vector representations of words (e.g. $\mathbf{w}_{\text{cat}}=[0.02, 0.29, ..., -0.34])$, where each component $w^{(i)}$ can be thought of as capturing a semantic or syntactic feature of the word, and the full vector $\mathbf{w}$ acts as co-ordinates for the word in a high-dimensional "semantic space". 

Word embeddings can be created as a list of word co-occurrence statistics (or their low-rank factorisation); or learned by a *neural network*, such as *[Word2Vec]* (W2V), *[GloVe]* or a large language model. We shall see that these are closely related, and that the latter *neural word embeddings* learn statistics for a task implied by the training algorithm, rather than being them being explicitly defined.

Neural word embeddings (or simply _embeddings_) are useful across a wide variety of tasks involving natural language, from identifying word similarity or grammatical role, to assessing the sentiment in a customer review. Here, we focus specifically on word embeddings learned by Word2Vec and GloVe as the relative simplicity of their training algorithm and model architevture allows rigorous analysis.

### Analogies

An intriguing property observed in trained word embeddings is that *analogies* are often solved simply by adding/subtracting them, e.g.:

"***man*** is to ***king*** as ***woman*** is to ***queen***"
{: style="text-align: center"}

can be *solved* using word embeddings by finding that closest to $$\mathbf{w}_{king}-\mathbf{w}_{man}+\mathbf{w}_{woman}$$ (omitting $man$, $woman$ and $king$ themselves), which often turns out to be $$\mathbf{w}_{queen}$$.
This suggests that:

$$
\begin{equation}
  \mathbf{w}_{king} - \mathbf{w}_{man} + \mathbf{w}_{woman} \approx \mathbf{w}_{queen}\,
  \tag{1}\label{eq:one}
\end{equation}
$$

or, in geometric terms, that ***word embeddings of analogies approximately form parallelograms:***
^
![word embeddings of analogies approximately form a paralellogram](/assets/analogy/parallelogram2.svg){:height="170px"}.
{: style="text-align: center"}

While this seems intuitive, the fact that *semantic* relationships between words appear as *geometric* relationships between word embeddings is intriguing since word embeddings are not trained to achieve it!
In practice, the parallelograms formed by word embeddings of analogies are not _perfect_:

![word embeddings of analogies not quite a paralellogram](/assets/analogy/analogy_embeddings.png){:height="250px"}
{: style="text-align: center"}

This shows the (exact) parallelogram formed by $$\mathbf{w}_{king}, \mathbf{w}_{man}, \mathbf{w}_{woman}$$ and a fourth vertex ($$\mathbf{w}_{king} {\small-} \mathbf{w}_{man} {\small+} \mathbf{w}_{woman}$$)
in the $xy$-plane with several word embeddings plotted relative to it. We see that (i) the embedding of $queen$ is not at the fourth vertex, but is the closest embedding to it; and (ii) that embeddings of 
related words, e.g. $$prince$$ and $$lord$$, are close relative to random words.

|To explain the relationship between word embeddings of analogies \eqref{eq:one}, we describe the gap (marked '?') between $$\mathbf{w}_{queen}$$ and $$\mathbf{w}_{king} {\small-} \mathbf{w}_{man} {\small+} \mathbf{w}_{woman}$$; and show that it is small, often smallest, for the word that we expect to complete the analogy.|
{:.mbtablestyle}

We begin by considering what W2V embeddings learn.

### Word2Vec

![W2V architecture](/assets/analogy/neural_network.png){:style="float: right; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: -10px;" height="250px"}

W2V (SkipGram with negative sampling) generates word embeddings by training the weights of a 2-layer "neural network"
to predict *context words* $$c_j$$ (i.e. words that fall within a context window of fixed size $$l$$) around each word  $$w_i$$ (the *target word*) over a text corpus.

To reduce the computational cost of computing $$p(c_j\!\mid\! w_i)$$ over all $$c_j$$ in a dictionary $$\mathcal{E}$$ using a softmax function, sigmoid functions were trained to classify truly occurring context words from words chosen at random (*negative samples*).

[Levy & Goldberg (2014)][levy-goldberg] showed that under this regime, matrices $$\mathbf{W}, \mathbf{C}$$ (whose columns are word embeddings $$\mathbf{w}_i, \mathbf{c}_j$$) 
approximately factorise a matrix of *shifted Pointwise Mutual Information* (PMI):

$$
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{W}^\top\mathbf{C} \approx \textbf{PMI} - \log k\ ,
\end{equation}
$$

where $k$ is the chosen number of negative samples and
$$
\begin{equation}
\textbf{PMI}_{i,j} = \text{PMI}(w_i, c_j) = \log\tfrac{p(w_i,\, c_j)}{p(w_i)p(c_j)}
\end{equation}\,.
$$

The *shift* $\log k$ is an arbitary artifact of the algorithm, which we address in the [paper] (Sec 5.5, 6.8) but drop here to simplify. The resulting relationship
$$
\mathbf{W}^\top\!\mathbf{C} \!\approx\! \textbf{PMI}
$$
implies that an embedding $$\mathbf{w}_i$$ can be seen as a *low-dimensional projection* of $$\text{PMI}_i$$, the $i^{th}$ row of the PMI matrix, or *PMI vector*.

{: #proof}
## Proving the embedding relationship of analogies

This suggests observed additive relationships between word embeddings \eqref{eq:one} follow if the projection from PMI vectors to word embeddings induced by the loss function is sufficiently linear and if equivalent relationships exists between PMI vectors, i.e.

$$
\begin{equation}
  \text{PMI}_{king} - \text{PMI}_{man} + \text{PMI}_{woman} \approx \text{PMI}_{queen}\ ;
  \tag{2}\label{eq:two}
\end{equation}
$$

A least squares loss gives precisely such a linear projection and we conjecture that W2V and Glove are sufficiently linear to preserve the relative spatial arrangement of vectors.

|To now prove that relationship \eqref{eq:two} arises between PMI vectors of an analogy, we translate it into a relationship based on **paraphrases** that equate to an analogy.|

### Paraphrases

Inuitively, when we say a word $$w_*$$ *paraphrases* a set of words $$\mathcal{W}$$, we mean that they are *semantically interchangeable* in the text. For example, wherever $$king$$ appears, we might 
instead see both $$man$$ <u>and</u>  $$royal$$.
Mathematically, we define the best paraphrase $$w^*$$ as the word that maximises the likelihood of the context words found around $$\mathcal{W}$$, such that the context word distribution around $$w_*$$ (denoted $$p(\mathcal{E}\!\mid\!w_*)$$) is most similar to that around $$\mathcal{W}$$ ($$p(\mathcal{E}\!\mid\!\mathcal{W})$$), measured by Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. Although these distributions are discrete and unordered, we can picture this intuitively as:

![Paraphrase distributions](/assets/analogy/distributions.png){:height="120px"}
{: style="text-align: center"}

> Definition: $$w_*$$ **paraphrases** $\mathcal{W}$ if the **paraphrase error** $${\rho}^{\mathcal{W}, w_*}\!\in\! \mathbb{R}^{n}$$
 is (element-wise) small:
>
$$
\begin{equation}
    {\rho}^{\mathcal{W}, w_*}_j = \log \tfrac{p(c_j|w_*)}{p(c_j|\mathcal{W})}\ ,   \quad c_j\!\in\!\mathcal{E}.
\end{equation}
$$

[comment]: # (\tag{3}\label{eq:three})

Paraphase error quantifies the similarity of the context distribution around any two words $$w_1, w_2$$ to that of **<u>any other word</u>** $$w_*$$ in terms of their PMI vectors:

![PMI relationship](/assets/analogy/equation_PMI.png){:height="230px"}
{: style="text-align: center"}

The difference comprises the *paraphrase error*, which is small only when $$w_*$$ paraphrases $$\{w_1, w_2\}$$, and *dependence error* terms that **<u>do not depend on $w_*$</u>**.
We formalise this as:

> Lemma 1:
For any word $$w_*\!\in\!\mathcal{E}$$ and word set $$\mathcal{W}\!\subseteq\!\mathcal{E}$$, $$|\mathcal{W}|\!<\!l$$, where $$l$$ is the context window size:
>
>$$
  \begin{equation}
    \text{PMI}_*
    \ =\
    \sum_{w_i\in\mathcal{W}} \text{PMI}_{i}
     \,+\, \rho^{\mathcal{W}, w_*}
     \,+\, \sigma^{\mathcal{W}}
     \,-\, \tau^\mathcal{W}\mathbf{1}\ .
\end{equation}
$$

[comment]: # (![Paraphrase distributions](/assets/analogy/lemma1-1.png){:height="100px"} {: style="text-align: left; margin-left: 30px"})

This connects paraphrasing to PMI vector *addition*, as appears in \eqref{eq:two}, and is readily generalised to quantify the relationship between *word sets*. We say $$\mathcal{W}$$ and $$\mathcal{W}_*$$ paraphrase one another if the distributions of context words around them are similar (this reduces to the original definition if $$\mathcal{W}_*$$ contains a single word). Lemma 1 naturally extends to:

> Lemma 2:
For any word sets $$\mathcal{W}, \mathcal{W}_*\!\subseteq\!\mathcal{E}$$; $$|\mathcal{W}|, |\mathcal{W}_*|\!<\!l$$:
>
>$$
  \begin{equation}
    \sum_{w_i\in\mathcal{W}_*} \text{PMI}_{i}
    \ =\
    \sum_{w_i\in\mathcal{W}} \text{PMI}_{i}
     \,+\, \rho^{\mathcal{W}, \mathcal{W}_*}
     \,+\, (\sigma^{\mathcal{W}} - \sigma^{\mathcal{W}_*})
     \,-\, (\tau^\mathcal{W} - \tau^{\mathcal{W}_*})\mathbf{1}
\end{equation}
$$

[comment]: # (![Paraphrase distributions](/assets/analogy/lemma2-1.png){:height="115px"} {: style="text-align: left; margin-left: 30px"})

To see how this relates to paraphrases, let $$\mathcal{W} \!=\! \{woman, king\}$$ and $$\mathcal{W}_* \!=\!  \{man, queen\}$$, whereby

$$
\begin{equation}
  \text{PMI}_{king} - \text{PMI}_{man} + \text{PMI}_{woman} \ \approx\ \text{PMI}_{queen}\ ,
\end{equation}
$$

if (a) $$\mathcal{W}$$ paraphrases $$\mathcal{W}_*$$ (i.e. $$\rho^{\mathcal{W}, \mathcal{W}_*}$$ is small) and (b) *net* statistical dependencies are small for words in $$\mathcal{W}$$ and 
$$\mathcal{W}_*$$ (i.e. $$\sigma^{\mathcal{W}} - \sigma^{\mathcal{W}_*}$$ and $$\tau^\mathcal{W} - \tau^{\mathcal{W}_*}$$).

|Thus, subject to dependence errors, \eqref{eq:two} holds if $$\{woman, king\}$$ paraphrases $$\{man, queen\}$$.|
{:.mbtablestyle}

This establishes that two *paraphrases* are a sufficient condition for the geometric relationship between word embeddings observed for an *analogy*.
What remains then, is to show that an analogy "$$w_a\text{ is to }w_{a^*}\text{ as }w_b\text{ is to }w_{b^*}$$" implies that $$\{w_b, w_{a^*}\!\}$$ paraphrases $$\{w_a, w_{b^*}\!\}$$.
In fact, we show an equivalence by reinterpreting paraphrases as *word transformations*.

### Word Transformation

The [paraphrasing](#paraphrases) of a word set $$\mathcal{W}$$ by a word $$w_*$$ can be interpreted as a semantic equivalence between $$\mathcal{W}$$ and $$w_*$$, denoted $$\approx_p$$. Alternatively, for a particular word $w$ in $\mathcal{W}$, a paraphrase indicates which words (the remainder of $$\mathcal{W}$$, denoted $$\mathcal{W}^+$$) that, when combined with $$w$$, make it "more like" -- or *transform* it to -- $$w_*$$. For example, the paraphrase of $$\{man, royal\}$$  by $$king$$ can be viewed as a *word transformation* from $$man$$ to $$king$$ by adding $$royal$$.
The added words have the effect of *narrowing the context* or, more precisely, alter the distribution of context words around $$w$$ to more closely align with that of $$w_*$$. We can illustrate this as:

![word transformation](/assets/analogy/word_trans_1.png){:width="300px"}
{: style="text-align: center"}

where the paraphrase acts as the "glue" in a relationship *from* $$w$$ *to* $$w_*$$.
Thus, for $$w\!\in\!\mathcal{W}$$ and $$\mathcal{W}^+ \!=\! \mathcal{W}\!\setminus\!\!\{w\}$$, saying "$$w_*$$ paraphrases $$\mathcal{W}$$" is equivalent to saying "there exists a word transformation 
from $$w$$ to $$w_*$$ by adding $$\mathcal{W}^+$$". Nothing changes other than the perspective.

Extending this to paraphrases between word sets $$\mathcal{W}$$, $$\mathcal{W}_*\!$$, we can choose $$w \!\in\! \mathcal{W}$$, $$w_* \!\in\! \mathcal{W}_*$$ and view the paraphrase as 
defining a relationship between $$w$$ and $$w_*$$ where $$\mathcal{W}^+ \!=\! \mathcal{W}\!\setminus\!\!\{w\}$$ is added to $$w$$ and $$\mathcal{W}^- \!=\! \mathcal{W_*}\!\!\setminus\!\!\{w_*\}$$ 
to $$w_*$$:

![word transformation](/assets/analogy/word_trans_2.png){:width="300px"}
{: style="text-align: center"}

This is not (yet) a word transformation, as it lacks the notion of direction *from* $$w$$ *to* $$w_*$$. But, rather than viewing words in $$\mathcal{W}^-$$ as *added* to $$w_*$$, we consider them *subtracted* from $$w$$ (hence our naming convention):

![word transformation](/assets/analogy/word_trans_3.png){:width="300px"}
{: style="text-align: center"}

Just as adding words narrows the context, subtracted words can be viewed as *broadening* the context.

> Definition: there exists a ***word transformation*** from $$w$$ to $$w_*$$ with ***transformation parameters*** $$\mathcal{W}^+$$, $$\mathcal{W}^-\subseteq\mathcal{E}$$    *iff*   $$\ \{w\}\!\cup\!\mathcal{W}^+ \approx_\text{P} \{w_*\}\!\cup\!\mathcal{W}^-$$.

#### Intuition

The intuition behind word transformations mirrors simple algebra: e.g. 5 is *transformed* to 8 by adding 3, but if 3 were somehow unavailable, then we could add 4 and subtract 1. With paraphrases alone, words can only be *added* to $$w$$ to transform it to $$w_*$$, and perhaps no word exists to describe such "semantic difference". With word transformations, *differences between words* can also be used offering a far richer toolkit, e.g. the difference between $$man$$ and $$king$$ might be described crudely by, say, $$royal$$ or $crown$, but is perhaps better described by the difference between $woman$ and $queen$. More generally, transformation parameters ($$\mathcal{W}^+, \mathcal{W}^-$$) *describe the difference* between $$w$$ and $$w_*$$ or, one might say, how "$$w$$ is to $$w_*$$".


### Interpreting Analogies

We can now mathematically interpret the language of an analogy:

> Definition (analogy): *"$$w_a$$ is to $$w_{a^*}$$ as $$w_b$$ is to $$w_{b^*}\!$$"* *iff* there exist transformation parameters $$\mathcal{W}^+\!, \mathcal{W}^-\!\subseteq\!\mathcal{E}$$ that simultaneously
transform both $$w_a$$ to $$w_{a^*}$$ and $$w_b$$ to $$w_{b^*}$$.

Each occurrence of "is to" in the analogy defintion is synonymous to a set of word transformation parameters and "as" implies their equality. Intuitively, this means that the semantic difference within each word pair, as now quantified, must be the same.

So, an analogy is a pair of word transformations with common parameters $$\mathcal{W}^+, \mathcal{W}^-$$, but what are those parameters? Fortunately, we need not search or guess. We show in the 
[paper] (Sec 6.4) that if an analogy holds, then *any* parameters that transform one of the word pairs, e.g. $$w_a$$ to $$w_{a^*}$$, *must also transform the other pair*.
We can therefore choose $$\mathcal{W}^+\!=\!\{w_{a^*}\!\}$$, $$\mathcal{W}^-\!=\!\{w_{a}\}$$. These trivially transform $$w_a$$ to $$w_{a^*}$$ since $$\{w_a, w_{a^*}\!\}$$ exactly paraphrases $$\{w_{a^*\!}, 
w_a\}$$ (word order is irrelevant). For the analogy to hold, those parameters must then also transform $$w_b$$ to $$w_{b^*}$$, i.e. $$\{w_b, w_{a^*}\}$$ paraphrases $$\{w_{b^*}, w_a\}$$, that is:

$$`\!`w_a \text{ is to } w_{a^*} \text{ as } w_b \text{ is to }  w_{b^*}\!\!" \quad\iff\quad  \{w_b, w_{a^*}\} \approx_\text{P} \{w_{b^*}, w_a\}.$$.

This completes the chain:
 - analogies are equivalent to word transformations with common transformation parameters describing the common "semantic difference";
 - those word transformations can be described in terms of a readily identifiable paraphrase;
 - that paraphrase implies the geometric relationship between PMI vectors \eqref{eq:two}, subject to accuracy of the paraphrase ($$\rho$$) and dependence error terms ($$\sigma, \tau$$); and
 - under a low-dimensional projection induced by the loss function, that geometric relationship manifests, as observed, in the word embeddings of analogies \eqref{eq:one}.

Returning to an initial plot, we can now explain the "gap" in terms of paraphrase ($$\rho$$) and dependence $$(\sigma, \tau$$) error terms, and understand why it is variable but often smallest for 
words that complete the analogy. This concludes an end-to-end explanation for the geometric relationship between word embeddings observed for word analogies.

## Related Work
Several other works aim to theoretically explain the analogy phenomenon, in particular:
 - [Arora et al. (2016)][arora] propose a latent variable model for text generation that is claimed *inter alia* to explain analogies, however strong *a priori* assumptions are made about the 
arrangement of word vectors that we do not require.
 - [Gittens et al. (2017)][gittens] introduce the idea of paraphrasing to explain analogies, from which we drew much inspiration, but they include several assumptions that fail in practice, in particular 
that word frequencies follow a uniform distribution rather than their true, highly non-uniform, Zipf distribution.
 - [Ethayarajh et al. (2019)][ethayarajh] aim to show that word embeddings of analogies form parallelograms by considering the latter's geometric properties. However, several strong assumptions are made that we do not require (e.g.  all embedding must already be co-planar and embedding matrix $$\mathbf{W}$$ must be a scalar multiple of $$\mathbf{C}$$) and analogies are ultimately related to a statistical relationship "csPMI" that lacks semantic meaning.
